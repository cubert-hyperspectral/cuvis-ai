"""Fixtures for testing.

All fixtures have been organized into separate modules in tests/fixtures/:
- paths.py: Path and configuration fixtures (temp dirs, config paths)
- data_factory.py: Test data creation factories
- mock_sdk.py: Mock CUVIS SDK

Import them via pytest's automatic discovery or explicitly from tests.fixtures.
